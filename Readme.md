Objective:

Build a RESTful API for a simple register new user and login.

Project Desciption:

In this project, I will create a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and NPM packages. The API will allow to register new use and login . The tasks should have a title, description, and a flag for completion status. The API should be tested using Postman.

Set up a basic Node.js project with Express.js and other necessary NPM packages.

Implement a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

 POST /register: Register new user.

 POST /login: Login existing user.

 Use an in-memory data store (e.g., an array) to store user registration.

Implement proper error handling for invalid requests.

Test the API using Postman to ensure it works as expected.
